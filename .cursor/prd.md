# Product Requirement Document: EHRSync

## 1. Overview

EHRSync is a full-stack system designed to integrate patient data with various Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. The platform allows hospitals and clinics to dynamically map patient responses to the appropriate EHR fields, ensuring seamless data transfer. The system prioritizes scalability, security, and maintainability.

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

Integrating patient data across multiple EHR systems is challenging due to the diverse API structures and field mappings of different vendors. Manual data entry increases the risk of errors, while rigid integrations limit scalability. EHRSync solves this by providing a standardized, modular, and scalable system for seamless interoperability.

## 3. Objectives

- Enable efficient mapping of patient data to multiple EHR systems.
- Ensure secure and compliant data transmission.
- Provide an intuitive frontend for managing EHR mappings.
- Design a scalable system that can handle millions of concurrent users.
- Implement performance optimizations for high-speed data processing.
- Support multi-tenancy to cater to multiple hospitals and clinics.

## 4. Features & Requirements

### 4.1 Must-Have Features

- **API for EHR Integration**: A modular REST API that maps and submits patient data to different EHR systems.
- **Mapping Management**: An admin panel to configure and update EHR field mappings.
- **Security & Compliance**: Data encryption (AES-256), input validation, and JWT-based authentication.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Robust validation, rollback mechanisms, and structured logs.
- **Scalability**: Caching (Redis), load balancing, and optimized database queries.
- **Observability & Monitoring**: Centralized logging (ELK stack), real-time alerts (Prometheus, Grafana).
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for different hospitals and providers.

### 4.2 Should-Have Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Ability to handle different languages in patient responses.
- **Bulk Update Functionality**: Allow batch updates of patient records for providers.
- **Performance Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of API transactions and system health.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Automated failover, database replication, and backup strategies.

### 4.3 Could-Have Features

- **Analytics & Reporting**: Insights into patient data trends.
- **AI-based Recommendations**: Automated suggestions for data corrections.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: A mobile-friendly version of the admin panel.

## 5. Technical Specifications

### 5.1 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, NestJS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for mappings), Redis (for caching)
- **Authentication**: JWT, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Hosting & Deployment**: AWS (EC2, RDS, S3), Docker

### 5.2 API Design

- **Base URL**: `/api/v1`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /mappings` – Create a new mapping
  - `GET /mappings` – Fetch all mappings
  - `PUT /mappings/:id` – Update a mapping
  - `DELETE /mappings/:id` – Remove a mapping
  - `POST /submit` – Submit patient data to the mapped EHR

## 6. Architecture & Data Flow

### 6.1 System Architecture

```mermaid
+----------------+     +--------------+     +-----------------+
|  Frontend UI  | --> |  API Layer   | --> |  EHR Adapters   |
+----------------+     +--------------+     +-----------------+
                                |
                                v
                        +----------------+
                        |  Database (SQL)|
                        +----------------+
```

- **Frontend**: Manages UI interactions for admins and clinicians.
- **API Layer**: Handles mapping, validation, and transaction processing.
- **EHR Adapters**: Middleware that transforms data for different EHR systems.
- **Database**: Stores mappings and transaction logs.

### 6.2 Data Flow

1. **User submits patient data** → API validates and logs request.
2. **API maps the request** to the correct EHR format.
3. **EHR Adapter transforms** data per EHR’s specifications.
4. **Data is submitted** to the EHR.
5. **Response is logged** and returned to the user.

## 7. User Roles & Permissions

- **Client**: Handle patient data, selects EHRs to submit to.
- **Patient**: Fill out patient data
- **Doctor**: Read patient data
- **Admin**: Manage EHR mappings, view logs, configure settings.

## 8. Performance & Scalability

- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for fast lookups.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute API traffic across instances.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Use message queues (RabbitMQ) for background jobs.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multi-region AWS deployments.

## 9. Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive fields.
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input sanitization, and request validation.
- **Compliance**: HIPAA-compliant logging and access control.

## 10. Testing & QA Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Jest (backend), React Testing Library (frontend).
- **Integration Testing**: Supertest for API validation.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Cypress for full workflow testing.
- **Security Testing**: OWASP ZAP scanning for vulnerabilities.

## 11. Timeline & Milestones

| Milestone | Description                          | Expected Completion |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Phase 1   | Backend API development              | Week 2              |
